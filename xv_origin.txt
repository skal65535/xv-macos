XV Origin Information:

XV is a powerful, albeit old, image viewer and editor originally created by John Bradley and last updated in 1996.

This repository aims to provide a clean environment for building XV on macOS. It includes:

2.  **Patches:**
    *   RPM Fusion patches (for Linux compatibility).
    *   Jumbo patches (enhancements and fixes).
    *   macOS modernization patch (`macos-modernization.patch`) to update APIs for modern macOS compatibility.
3.  **Build Configuration:** A CMakeLists.txt file tailored for building XV on macOS.
4.  **Build Script:** A shell script (`scripts/build_macos.sh`) to automate the build process on macOS, including dependency installation via Homebrew.
